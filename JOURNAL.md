## 10/28/2025 - Finished 1st draft of schematic.  

Since I'm a complete beginner at designing schematics in Kicad![Radio3](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8244b32bd145d186ab2d67992ab19cf5fc3fee5e/Radio3.PNG)
, I choose an easier project then the Frequency Generator for Healing that is practical and useful. I finished the schematic, learned about the EFC Checker, got 47 errors of unconnected pins, put X symbols over them, left with 2 errors of "input pins not driven by output power pins", put PWR Flags over the error pins, got zero errors with EFC.  

## 10/31/2025 - Implemented power system, learned about Kicad Plugins  

I worked on adding footprints for my components and implemented a power system. I decided to use those AA rechargeable batteries that can be recharged using USB C. I learned about Interactive Html BOM plugin and generated a sample BOM, after updating the unfinished schematic to my pcb file.![Screenshot 2025-10-31 205401](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzI5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--00ae956b80800c418cc192c2d76390ec2a41109b/Screenshot%202025-10-31%20205401.png)
  

## 11/2/2025 - Forgot to add a screen and a flashable ESP32 dev board  

I was working on the PCB for the radio, because I thought I finished the schematic, using the Freerouting plugin to auto route the connections, when it occurred to me that the ESP32 model I chose didn't have a USB-C port, therefore it wasn't reprogrammable. I also added a LCD color screen. I'm considering switching to EasyEDA for finding models of components easier.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--221618c75b05687794a125798c80d97fd03d7686/image.png)![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--68a9df849b6106573e6469c0f5f2ab02f21ce374/image.png)

  

## 11/4/2025 - Finished schematic 2nd draft, almost finished PCB wiring

I completed the schematic, and went on to do the PCB wiring and arrangement. It felt like a puzzle, trying to wire pins while dodging other wires and changing color or wire. I used the Freerouting plugin to start me up, then wired the unconnected pins. I have 2 left. (Sorry wrong image uploaded)  

## 11/6/2025 - Finished PCB  

I fixed the errors in the DRC like reference text cutting off silkscreen of capacitor 2 and 3. I just need to organize the files and journaling and ship.
