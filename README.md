# ESP32_Smart_Walkie_Talkie
This is a smart walkie talkie using an ESP32 development board. It functions as a walkie talkie. It uses a LoRa module to send radio signals 1 km+, and has smart features such as a low battery alert and a RSSI Signal Bar.

I made this project to allow people to contact each other where cellular data wasn't an option. It would be especially helpful in a remote environment such as a forest, to talk with somebody, or broadcast your signal in case of emergencies. I wanted my first Blueprint project to be useful to the everyday public.
